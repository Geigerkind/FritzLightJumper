# TomTom (FritzLight-Jumper)

This is the end term functional programming project.

The task was to program something for the FritzLight-System, which is a LED System of the dimension 30x12.

Our goal was to create a dexterity game where the player is supposed to master a parcour.

Therefore we defined the following specifications for the project:
- Game Menu screen, flashy animation and name label
- Game Over screen, showing whether the highscore was busted or not
- Highscore that is saved upon sessions
- Pseudo-Random parcour generation with increasing difficulty over time
- Basic physics (Jumping, Collision)
- Player controls (Handling the player inputs)
- Showing current score during the game
- Using monadic structures
